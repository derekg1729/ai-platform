# Core Concepts

AI Agent Hub consists of three main components: Platform App, AI Models, and Agent Instances.

## Platform App

The central hub where developers and users interact with AI models and agents.

- Browse available models
- Deploy personal agents
- Configure API connections
- Monitor performance


## AI Models

Blueprints that define how an agent behaves:
- Standardized API contract
- Input/output specifications
- Required API connections
- Deployment configuration
- Pricing structure

## Agent Instances

Personalized deployments of AI Models with:
- Custom API keys and settings
- Usage metrics
- Health monitoring
- Log management

### Lifecycle
1. Deploy: Select model to deploy
2. Configure: Set up API keys
3. Activate: Start the instance
4. Monitor: Track performance
5. Update: Receive model updates
