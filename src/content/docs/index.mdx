# Introduction

AI Agent Hub enables platform developers to build and ship AI models as standardized microservices, while allowing users to browse, deploy, and manage personalized agent instances.

## Quick Start

1. Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/derekg1729/ai-platform
cd ai-platform
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Key Features

- **Model Marketplace**: Browse and discover AI models
- **Agent Management**: Deploy and configure personal agent instances
- **API Integration**: Connect agents with third-party services
- **Usage Analytics**: Monitor performance and usage metrics
